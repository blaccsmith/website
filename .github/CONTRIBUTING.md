# Contributing to BLACC

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests, so Be sure to fork the repo and create your branch from `staging`.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/BLACC-Smith/website/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/BLACC-Smith/website/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

The key to a bug  or feature report is to provide as much detail as possible. If you have a recommendation for a solution provide that as well. Include why you think this might be helpful to the community to know.

Once you create a feature or bug report, look for comments and/or questions from the viewer.
