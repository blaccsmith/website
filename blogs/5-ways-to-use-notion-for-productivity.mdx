Investing in your productivity is one of the best investments you'll make in your life. But what exactly does that look like? While there might an abundance of productivity apps and tools available on the internet, they are not always straightforward and a little bit of guidance can go a long way. In this article I'll share 5 ways I use Notion (my favorite productivity app) to get inspired, organized, and productive. 

## 1.Coding Notes

Notion is one of the best tools available for writing coding notes if you're a developer or software engineer. I created a system whereby I sort my technologies in a Kanban board to easily find my notes. I also use Notion to create coding cheatsheets!
Within these notes I use code snippets, YouTube embeds, CodePen and CodeSandbox embeds to create extensive notes that help me save so much time when looking for information.

##  2.Work Organization

I organize my works tasks on Notion and it's incredible at helping me stay organized! 

I created a page for my job in which I use multiple inline boards to help me track my progress on various projects. I use tags to label my work and know the status of each project and to label meeting notes.

## 3.Vision Board With Goal List attached

One thing Notion is particularly good at it's helping you display information in multiple ways - you can show the same pieces of information in varying formats from table to board to calendar. 

I use the gallery display to create a vision board. The best part is that unlike regular vision boards this one is clickable! And each image opens up to my goals for that section!

## 4.Cooking List

I created another gallery on Notion that this time helps me decide what to cook with what I have in my fridge & pantry. To do this I took pictures of meals I've cooked and gave each a page in my gallery. Then I tagged them by ingredient. So when I go to my gallery I can filter out the pictures by ingredients based on what I have available to cook. This helps me remember what to cook when I'm indecisive about what to cook.

## 5.Journal

I have quite an interesting way of journaling on Notion. I set up a Kanban board where each tag is a different month. Under each month I write random journal entries. I love this format because I can see the text in my entries from the gallery view and see what I wrote every month quickly.


#I hope these ideas inspire you to get started on your own Notion journey!
