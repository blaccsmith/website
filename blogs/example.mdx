First, never risk more capital than you’re willing to lose. Meaning if you risk $500 in any investment in any asset class and it goes to zero, don’t get mad.
Investing is a risk but:

Always bank black, it’s illogical, as black people living in America not to bank with our people. This article focuses on the concept of cryptocurrency, so please read below carefully.

## What is cryptocurrency?

Crypto is basically digital money that cannot be hacked or duplicated due to the nature of cryptography and the use of immutable ledgers.
See below link for details. The most interesting thing about crypto living in a first-world environment is that you can make money trading/holding long-term, no different than the stock market.
In developing countries, however, it is used to safely bank and have access to currencies that are less likely to fall victim to inflation on the country’s local currency. More about [cryptocurrency](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cryptocurrency.asp).

## What are the different cryptocurrencies and how to invest?

There are currently over 4,000 cryptocurrencies in circulation, but not all have good use cases. Bitcoin was the first created in 2009, followed by Ethereum in 2015.
The entire market lives off of the success and failure of Bitcoin since the market is paired with BTC. As it increases or decreased in value, so do what is known as ALT Coins.

Investing is easy but requires more action and thought versus the stock market. First, you need to on-ramp your fiat (cash) to a digital exchange, such as Coinbase or Gemini.
Both applications call for KYC (Know your customer) which is your personal information. Many tokens, known as shares on the stock market may be found on different exchanges all over the world,
so you may need to send ETH (Ethereum) for example, to an ETH wallet on a foreign exchange to gain the token you want.

## Storage of Cryptocurrency

It is a good idea never to leave your assets on any exchanges for security reasons. You may want to purchase a hardware wallet like Nano Ledger or Trezor. With Nano Ledger, you’ll have to maintain
a small balance of ETH to send from the blockchain which is called gas. It’s just the fee you pay for your money to be sent. There are more wallets out there, but those mentioned are well known.
Hardware wallets provide you with a sense of security and to know your money is in your total control. You never truly own your assets in crypto until you control your private keys.

## What is a Digital Wallet?

A digital wallet is the same as a hardware wallet, but it is app or internet browser-based. With digital wallets, you are at the mercy of the provider because you are not 100 percent in control
because if the app goes down or is under maintenance you won’t be able to access your funds but there are a lot of good applications like Trust wallet. I just prefer to always be in control and
having a hardware wallet is the most control you will have. Digital wallets take a matter of minutes to set up but may take some time to verify your identity depending on how that particular app is set up.

## Good Resource Material

It is a good idea to do a lot of research before investing any serious capital into cryptocurrency. Below are links to YouTube channels that have good crypto news and information, but there are a
ton of Creators all over YouTube that have useful information that you can search for. You have to be willing to dedicate a lot of time and energy to trading and holding if you want to win long term.
