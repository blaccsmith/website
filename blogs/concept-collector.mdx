I love this so much because it's easy to get overwhelmed in tech with all the coding languages and tools available to us. But when you think of yourself as a concept-collector you can start to identify patterns in the things you're learning.


For example, I noticed that no matter what framework I use, web development is essentially made up of these building blocks:

🌄Views -> What's being displayed to the user

🎢Events -> The different things that a user 'causes to happen'

🚨Event Handling -> What we do after the user causes things to happen

🗳Storage -> Data/information needs to be stored and retrieved

🚏Routing and Controllers -> Allows us to create conceptual locations for where data/information should live

⚒Optimization -> Making things run as smoothly as possible


In other words:

The user needs to see something
The user needs to interact with what they see and make things happen
When they cause something to happen I need to decide what occurs next
My data needs to be stored somewhere, and I need to be able to access it
I use routes to allow the user to access data kept in different locations
I optimize to make things run smoother

When you learn something new, try to grasp the deeper meaning of what's being done. 𝘊𝘰𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘭𝘢𝘯𝘨𝘶𝘢𝘨𝘦𝘴 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘴𝘺𝘯𝘵𝘢𝘹𝘦𝘴 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘰𝘯𝘭𝘺 𝘢 𝘮𝘦𝘢𝘯𝘴 𝘵𝘰 𝘢𝘯 𝘦𝘯𝘥, 𝘢 𝘸𝘢𝘺 𝘵𝘰 𝘢𝘤𝘤𝘰𝘮𝘱𝘭𝘪𝘴𝘩 𝘢 𝘱𝘶𝘳𝘱𝘰𝘴𝘦. If you notice these patterns you'll be able to switch between frameworks and languages much more easily and confidently!
