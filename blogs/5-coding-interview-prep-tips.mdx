Coding interviews.

I know, they're not particularly the highlight of the job finding experience. For people who are new at them, it's hard to find out where to start, and it's easy to get discouraged when you don't get it right the first time. For people who are more experienced, it can be tedious to have to refresh your memory on data structures and algorithms that you haven't used in some time. From crying in some of my earliest mock interivews (**yes, I've cried in a mock interview before**), to getting internship and full time offers from companies like Google, Microsoft, and Lyft, I've managed to find some tips and tricks to help making coding interviews and preparing for them a bit easier. 

**And don't worry, "use Leetcode" and "read Cracking the Coding Interview" aren't on this list.**

## 1.  Time yourself

Remember how back when we did standardized tests there would be practice tests that were timed to simulate the real thing? That can be applied to coding interviews. I've had people tell me that one of the most stressful portions of the coding interview is trying to answer the question to the best of your ability while watching the clock. For most coding interviews, they last about 30-45 minutes. So, to help prepare for your next interview, try setting a timer! And don't worry if you don't answer your practice question in time. Just see how far you can get!

## 2. Understand techniques

Some people will say that if you do enough LC (LeetCode) you'll run into a similar problem in your interview. This is true, but I was never one to grind 5000 leetcode questions to prepare for interviews because it didn't align with my own learning style. A tip that I got when I was a [Google STEP intern](https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/116346902351356614/) in 2019 was that it's important to understand the correlation between the wording of a problem and its solution. For example, some arrays and strings problems may need a [two-pointer](https://leetcode.com/articles/two-pointer-technique/) approach, while others may need a [sliding window approach](https://medium.com/leetcode-patterns/leetcode-pattern-2-sliding-windows-for-strings-e19af105316b). Try to understand some popular techniques and see where they can be applied to your next practice question!

## 3. Split your coding question topics up

Oftentimes you'll see questions split up in categories of difficulty, but one way that I prepped for my interviews was splitting the questions up by topic (arrays and strings, recursion, dynamic programming, etc.). I knew that I did well in questions that involved trees and recursion, and in some ways I would give myself confirmation bias by leaning towards doing those kinds of questions over others. If you find yourself doing that, try making a list of data structures and algorithms topics and do 3-4 questions of each (not all at once, of course!)

## 4. Create a list of questions to ask your interviewer

For a full-time position, you'll likely have 3-4 interviewers, and it's important to ask each one maybe 2-3 questions ready for when they ask, "Do you have any questions for me?" 

>Remember: they're interviewing you to see if you're a good fit for them, but this is also your time to ask questions to see if they're a good fit for you! 

Here's a short list of some of my favorites:

1.  How has working at **(company)** helped you grow as a **(role)**?

2.  What opportunities has **(company)** brought you that previous companies haven't?

3.  What does it mean to be an impactful/successful **(role)** at **(company)**?

4.  A lot of people tell new **(role)** to always ask questions when they first start. What other advice would give a **(role)** who's starting tomorrow?

## 5.  Watch other people do interviews for a while

This isn't a must, and some people may not find much use out of it, but I found that watching [ interviewing.io](https://www.youtube.com/c/interviewingio/videos) videos for a while and sometimes even coding along with them helped with preparing for my own interviews, even if it was just to calm my own nerves from watching other people go through the process too.


All in all, interviews can be stressful whether you're a freshman in college, or a seasoned engineer, but remember that coding interviews are a skill just as riding a bike is. The more you practice, the better you'll get! And try to keep in mind that whether you get the offer or not, you still walk away with experience and transferable skills, so it's never a loss on you. Good luck out there!
